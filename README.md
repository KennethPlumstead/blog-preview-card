# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card Component

This is my solution to the [Blog Preview Card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge involves creating a responsive blog preview card component that displays a blog post's title, description, and image.

## Overview

- **Challenge**: Build a responsive blog preview card component that displays a title, description, and an image.
- **Objective**: Use HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript to replicate the design provided and make it responsive.
- **Tech Stack**: HTML, and CSS (Flexbox for layout).


## Features

- A clean, modern, and responsive design.
- Displays the blog card with a title, description, and a linked image.
- Hover effect to reveal a more interactive look.
- Mobile-friendly layout (using Flexbox).
- Accessible and semantic HTML structure.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KennethPlumstead/blog-preview-card.git
   cd blog-preview-card

2. Open index.html in your browser:
   
   You can open the index.html file directly in your browser to view the component.
   Alternatively, if you have a local server setup (using something like Live Server in VS Code), you can view the site that way.

## Technologies Used

	•	HTML5 for structure.
	•	CSS3 for styling (Flexbox for layout and transitions).
	•	Hover Effects: CSS transitions to enhance the user experience.

## Challenges Faced

	•	Creating the hover effect where the image subtly changes and the text overlay appears. This was achieved using CSS transitions.
	•	Ensuring the design is responsive on mobile devices, ensuring the card maintains proper scaling.
	•	Aligning the text and images properly to ensure that the card looks balanced across different screen sizes.

## Result

The Blog Preview Card component is now responsive and adjusts based on the screen size. It includes the main image, title, description, and a hover effect that enhances user interaction. The design meets all the requirements specified in the challenge, and the component works seamlessly across different devices.
